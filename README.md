# HAGIWO-Sequencer
A This is a simple all in 1 pcb+panel  PCB for HAGIWO 6 channel drum sequencer and Euclidian sequencer

It's a straight drop in eurorack size panel with smd components and no cover plate.

This project is not my design nor software. It is just a basic,cheap pcb, using Hagiwo's original work. 

Cost for a 5 batch (5 is a minimum order) from jlcpcb or pcbway should be in the $20/$25 range.

You can find all info on this project, schematics, code and info here (please support Hagiwo's work if you can) : 
Drum Sequencer : https://note.com/solder_state/n/n17c69afd484d
Euclidean rhythm sequencer : https://note.com/solder_state/n/n433b32ea6dbc

All you need for this project is the code (see Hagiwo's pages above) to program the arduino.
You then can use the gerber and BOM to order the parts for your project, idealy pre-soldered SMD components.

You will then need to source and manually solder 
a 16 pin IDE connector, 
pots , 
audio connector, 
SSD1306 OLED display , 
Rotary encoder module
an arduino nano...

...
and enjoy
